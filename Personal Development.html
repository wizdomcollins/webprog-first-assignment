		</h3>
		</center>
		<p> Take action, achieve my goals, practice proper time management, surround myself with like-minded individuals
			who share my values, and become a lifelong learner are some of the valuable lessons I take away from these
			chapters. </p>

		<p>Setting goals are crucial because it provides a benchmark for measuring my progress. Without clear goals,
			it's difficult to determine my success. Writing down my goals can enhance cognitive awareness and
			commitment. i will apply this technique in my everyday life starting with small goals that are steps in
			achieving my long term goal(s)</p>

		<p>I will design my life's plan to avoid falling into the influence of those who don't align with my
			aspirations. Prioritize my desired activities, as time is a valuable resource that diminishes over time.
			Surround myself with winners, successful individuals who embody the values and skills I seek to acquire and
			develop. </p>

		<p>Overall, these chapters offer practical advice and insights on personal growth, building strong
			relationships, effective time management, and achieving my financial success and if i follow these steps
			carefully I will be well on my way to success.</p>
